[markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

### links

`[whatever you want the link to say](https://futuredeath.agency)`

#### images (replace `WHAT_EVER_IMAGE.jpg` with whatever image...)  

`![alt text](/assets/images/WHAT_EVER_IMAGE.jpg)`

upload images here: [/assets/images/](https://github.com/lb2410/lorenebouboushian.org/tree/master/assets/images)

upload carousel images to the [/assets/images/carousel/](https://github.com/lb2410/lorenebouboushian.org/tree/master/assets/images/carousel) directory. note that images are displayed in alpha/numeric order so name yr images like `0.jpg` `1.png` `666.gif` and so on.

image that is a link:

```md
[![some image alt text](/assets/images/WHAT_EVER_IMAGE.jpg)](http://WHATEVER.URL)
```

## directories

[/_pages/](https://github.com/lb2410/lorenebouboushian.org/tree/master/_pages) every file in this directory will get added, as a link, to the main navigation. 

to add a new page create a new .md file in the _pages/ directory named like: `WHATEVER.md`. 

pages need this at the top (note the position is a number that sets the order it's positioned in the navigation):

```yaml
---
layout: page
name: THE NAME OF YOUR PAGE
position: 1
---
```

[/_posts/](https://github.com/lb2410/lorenebouboushian.org/tree/master/_posts) the post with the newest date will get shown on the home/landing page. to create a new post add a file with a name like `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-something.md` (ex: `2018-10-24-autumn.md`). posts need this at the top:

```yaml
---
layout: page
title:  WHATEVER YOU WANT YOUR PAGE TO BE TITLE
date: 2018-10-24
categories: stuff
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---
```

_note:_ put `<!--more-->` at the bottom of page (anything that comes after `<!--more-->` will get cutoff on the landing/home page).
