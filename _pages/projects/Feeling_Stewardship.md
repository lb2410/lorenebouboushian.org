# FEELING STEWARDSHIP

{% include carousel.html %}

Feeling Stewardship is an interactive installation that asked audiences to tune in deeply through meditation, examine the complexity of their family histories, then envision what they would like to steward for future generations by writing, drawing, and reading activist texts. 

I would like to expand Feeling Stewardship by engaging audiences in more concrete questions around how they can spark change in their communities. I want to deepen my family research and present it in more detail, then suggest that all of our histories provide opportunities for inspiration as well as reconciliation and healing. I envision the installation ending with a workbook that guides audiences through formulating radical new modes of self-care, community engagement, and considering our futures.
